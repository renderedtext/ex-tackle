# Tackle

[![Build Status](https://semaphore.semaphoreci.com/badges/ex-tackle/branches/master.svg?style=shields)](https://semaphore.semaphoreci.com/projects/ex-tackle)

Tackles the problem of processing asynchronous jobs in reliable manner
by relying on RabbitMQ.

You should also take a look at [Ruby Tackle](https://github.com/renderedtext/tackle).

## Why should I use tackle?

- It is ideal for fast microservice prototyping
- It uses sane defaults for queue and exchange creation
- It retries messages that fail to be processed
- It stores unprocessed messages into a __dead__ queue for later inspection

## Installation

Add the following to the list of your dependencies:

``` elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tackle, github: "renderedtext/ex-tackle"}
  ]
end
```

Also, add it to the list of your applications:

``` elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:tackle]]
end
```

## Publishing messages to an exchange

To publish a message to an exchange:

``` elixir
options = %{
  url: "amqp://localhost",
  exchange: "test-exchange",
  routing_key: "test-messages",
}

Tackle.publish("Hi!", options)
```

The previous example will open a new connection, create the exchange if it
doesn't exists, and close the connection. This makes sure that everything is
place, but has pretty bad performance.

For fast publishing of multiple messages, open a channel manually, make sure
that the exchange exists, and publish messages with `Tackle.Exchange.publish`.
Example:

``` elixir
{:ok, c}  = Tackle.Connection.open(:publisher, "amqp://localhost")
channel   = Tackle.Channel.create(c)
exchange  = Tackle.Exchange.create(channel, "test-exchange")
route_key = "hello"

(1..1_000) |> Enum.each(fn _ ->
  Tackle.Exchange.publish(channel, exchange, "Hi!", routing_key)
end)
```

## Consuming messages from an exchange

First, declare a consumer module:

``` elixir
defmodule TestConsumer do
  use Tackle.Consumer,
    url: "amqp://localhost",
    exchange: "test-exchange",
    routing_key: "test-messages",
    service: "my-service"

  def handle_message(message) do
    IO.puts "A message arrived. Life is good!"

    IO.puts message
  end
end
```

And then start it to consume messages:

``` elixir
TestConsumer.start_link
```

## Rescuing dead messages

If you consumer is broken, or in other words raises an exception while handling
messages, your messages will end up in a dead messages queue.

To rescue those messages, you can use `Tackle.republish`:

``` elixir
dead_queue_name = "my-service.test-message.dead"

options = {
  url: "amqp://localhost",
  queue: dead_queue_name,
  exchange: "test-exchange",
  routing_key: "test-messages",
  count: 1
}

Tackle.republish(options)
```

The above will pull one message from the `dead_queue_name` and publish it on the
`test-exchange` exchange with `test-messages` routing key.

To republish multiple messages, use a bigger `count` number.

## Opening multiple channels through the same connection

By default each channel (consumer) opens separate connection to the server.

If you want to reduce number of opened connections from one Elixir application
to RabbitMQ server, you can map multiple channels to single connection.

Each connection can have name, supplied as optional parameter `connection_id`.
All consumers that have the same connection name share single connection.

Parameter `connection_id` is optional and if not supplied,
`connection_id` is set to `:default`.
Value `:default` has exceptional semantic: all channels with `connection_id`
set to `:default` use separate connections - one channel per `:default` connection.

#### To use this feature

In consumer specification use `connection_id` parameter:
```
defmodule Consumer do
  use Tackle.Consumer,
    url: "...",
    connection_id: :connection_identifier,
    ...
```
